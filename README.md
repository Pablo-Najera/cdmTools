## Instalation
To install this package from source:
1. Windows users may need to install the [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) and include the checkbox option of installing Rtools to their path for easier command line usage. Mac users will have to download the necessary tools from the [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) and its related command line tools (found within Xcode's Preference Pane under Downloads/Components); most Linux distributions should already have up to date compilers (or if not they can be updated easily).
2. Install the `devtools` package (if necessary), and install the package from the Github source code.
